Help:

You have limited ammunation, so make each bullet count
nuke does not affect the final boss
if cargos are destroyed, you will have cash penalty
the time limit for game is 1minute
try to defeat as many as enemies as you can
the goal is to defeat the foxtrot with most kills
for 5+ killstreaks, w/o dying, you will get a care package as a reward
you don't lose your upgrades if you die
witch contains either health-damageup-life-nuke
the game gets harder as the time passes by
you will see your status when you die or finish the game

Tips:

look out for kamikazes :D
your life is limited, while the enemies are'nt
try to savage ammo as much as you can
